# fantasy-dashboard

## [Here](https://alistairwilliamtaylor.github.io/fantasy-dashboard/) is the website

## Please help to keep me up to date!!!

If you completely break this thing it's not a big deal. It's a glorified list of links. Just go for it!

To provide links for the website, just edit files by clicking the pencil icon in top right corner of the following files, and enter the label (some meaningful description of what it is) and href (the url). THEN CLICK "COMMIT CHANGES" (green button, top right)

[ADD AGM LINKS HERE](https://github.com/alistairwilliamtaylor/fantasy-dashboard/blob/main/src/AGM/linksAGM.js)

[ADD CONSTITUTION LINKS HERE](https://github.com/alistairwilliamtaylor/fantasy-dashboard/blob/main/src/Constitution/linksConstitution.js)

[ADD KEEPERS LINKS HERE](https://github.com/alistairwilliamtaylor/fantasy-dashboard/blob/main/src/Keepers/linksKeepers.js)

[ADD DRAFTS LINKS HERE](https://github.com/alistairwilliamtaylor/fantasy-dashboard/blob/main/src/Drafts/linksDrafts.js)



Just follow the pattern and add another one, e.g.
```
const links = [
    {
        label:"AGM proposals",
        href:'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IyPR-2wBNFr-JoTLk2HOzV8UeoHqUE9XEXwD3BMBmSA',
    },
    {
        label:"YOUR LABEL HERE",
        href:"YOUR_URL_HERE",
    },
]

export default links
```
